    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>Time Capsule: Memory Vault ("Time Capsule", "the App") is developed by Austin Frankel. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or share any personal data. The App operates entirely offline and on-device.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you create in the App — including photos, videos, audio recordings, text notes, and capsule metadata — is stored locally on your device. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Media files are stored in the App's sandboxed Documents directory with iOS file protection.</li>
        <li>Capsule data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework in a local database.</li>
        <li>Preferences (theme, language, onboarding progress) are stored in UserDefaults on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data is sent to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs. The App uses only native Apple frameworks.</p>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>
    <p>The App uses AES-256 encryption (via Apple's CryptoKit framework) to protect exported capsule files (.ltc format). Encryption keys are generated locally and are never transmitted.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request the following device permissions, which you can grant or deny at any time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture photos and videos for your time capsules.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To record voice memos for your time capsules.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To select existing photos for your time capsules.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To remind you when a capsule is ready to open.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time from Settings within the App. Uninstalling the App also removes all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule does not knowingly collect any information from children. All data remains on-device and is never transmitted.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
