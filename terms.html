    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Time Capsule: Memory Vault application ("Time Capsule", "the App") developed by Austin Frankel. By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using Time Capsule, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. License</h2>
    <p>Austin Frankel grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Standard End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule allows you to create digital time capsules containing photos, videos, audio recordings, text notes, and files. Capsules are sealed with a future unlock date and stored locally on your device. The App operates entirely offline.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are solely responsible for all content you add to your time capsules.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining backups of your device. Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the App or losing your device will result in loss of your capsule data.</li>
        <li>You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All content remains on your device. For full details, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Encryption</h2>
    <p>The App uses AES-256 encryption to protect exported capsule files (.ltc format). Encryption keys are generated and stored locally on your device. Austin Frankel cannot recover lost encryption keys or capsule data.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, code, graphics, and branding, is the intellectual property of Austin Frankel and is protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Austin Frankel does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Austin Frankel shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Loss</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, Austin Frankel is not responsible for any data loss resulting from device failure, App deletion, iOS updates, or any other cause. You are encouraged to use the export feature to back up important capsules.</p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Terms</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is also subject to Apple's Terms of Service and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Standard EULA</a>. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Apple's EULA, Apple's EULA shall prevail.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will update the date at the top of this page when changes are made.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or the App.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
